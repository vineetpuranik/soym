## Project goals

### QEMU Environment Setup

* Use QEMU to simulate the assembly of a computer (motherboard, CPU, memory, I/O devices).
* This environment will resemble a basic physical computer that we can build upon.

### Firmware Development

* Write a small firmware that connects the CPU with peripherals (memory, I/O).
* This will resemble the startup process of a computer, where firmware initializes hardware.

### Bare-Metal OS
* Develop a bare-metal program that lets the CPU interact with devices in a structured way.
* This will resemble how a minimal operating system manages communication between CPU and devices.

### Game Implementation
* Build a simple interactive game that runs on top of the bare-metal OS.
* This will resemble how applications execute on an OS once hardware and system software are in place.
