## QEMU environment

Use a Default QEMU Setup for a Modern Computer

Well-supported: The -M pc machine emulates a standard IBM-PC‚Äìstyle platform, which modern laptops and desktops are built on.

Familiar hardware: CPU = x86_64, GPU = VGA-compatible, I/O = PS/2 keyboard, serial port ‚Üí all classic, well-documented.

Easy graphics: With VGA text mode (0xB8000) or simple framebuffers, you can start drawing on the ‚Äúscreen‚Äù without writing a full GPU driver.

Rich ecosystem: The OSDev Wiki, hobby OS projects (e.g., xv6, Limine loaders) all use this configuration ‚Üí lots of guides to lean on.

Cross-platform: Same setup runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows laptops ‚Üí no special hardware needed.

‚úÖ This gives you the fastest path from ‚Äúbootloader‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúplayable game.‚Äù

2. Components Provided in This QEMU Setup

When you run qemu-system-x86_64 -M pc -kernel kernel.bin, QEMU emulates these main parts:

CPU

Model: x86_64 (Intel/AMD-compatible).

Supports real mode (16-bit), protected mode (32-bit), and long mode (64-bit).

Comes with registers (RAX, RBX, RIP, RSP, etc.), control registers, MMU.

Memory

Emulates RAM (you can pick size, e.g., -m 256M).

At boot, CPU starts at a fixed reset vector (0xFFFFFFF0).

Includes memory-mapped I/O regions for devices.

Firmware

By default, QEMU boots with SeaBIOS (a BIOS implementation).

Optionally, you can use OVMF (UEFI).

This firmware initializes devices and then loads your kernel.

Display (GPU/VGA)

Default: VGA card (-vga std, -vga cirrus, etc.).

Text mode (80√ó25 chars at 0xB8000).

Graphics mode (mode 13h: 320√ó200, 256 colors at 0xA0000).

Lets you draw characters or pixels by directly writing to video memory.

Input Devices

Keyboard: PS/2 keyboard controller emulated.

Mouse: optional, but also PS/2-compatible.

You can capture keys directly ‚Üí useful for games.

Timers

PIT (Programmable Interval Timer): old-school, but works for generating interrupts.

HPET / APIC timers: more modern, QEMU supports them.

You‚Äôll use one of these to drive your game loop (‚Äútick every X ms‚Äù).

Storage (Optional)

Can emulate hard disks, CD-ROMs, floppy disks.

Not needed for your project unless you want to load levels/files.

Serial Port

Useful for debugging.

With -serial stdio, all serial output goes to your terminal.

3. Computer Architecture of Each Piece (High-Level)

Let‚Äôs connect the dots as if you were designing a physical computer:

CPU

Core of the system, executes instructions.

Fetches instructions from memory, decodes, executes, writes back results.

Can address RAM and device registers via memory-mapped I/O.

Memory

Hierarchical architecture:

Registers (inside CPU)

Cache (L1/L2/L3)

RAM (main memory, where your kernel/game lives)

ROM/Flash (where firmware lives)

On reset, CPU executes from firmware location ‚Üí sets up RAM ‚Üí jumps to your code.

GPU (VGA)

Memory-mapped device with its own video RAM (VRAM).

When you write to VRAM (e.g., 0xB8000), the VGA controller renders that content to the ‚Äúscreen.‚Äù

Simple but powerful: you can update characters/pixels in real time.

I/O Devices (Keyboard, Timer, Serial)

Keyboard: CPU reads scancodes via I/O ports (0x60).

Timer: fires interrupts at regular intervals ‚Üí lets your game run at steady FPS.

Serial: behaves like a byte stream ‚Üí useful for logging or even multiplayer experiments.

Bus / Interconnect

Conceptually, all devices (RAM, VGA, keyboard, etc.) are connected over a system bus.

CPU uses this bus to talk to devices via memory addresses or I/O ports.

QEMU simulates this wiring automatically.

‚úÖ So in short: the default QEMU ‚Äúmodern PC‚Äù setup is like a stripped-down laptop:

CPU = x86_64

Memory = RAM + ROM

GPU = VGA-compatible device (easy framebuffer)

Input = PS/2 keyboard

Timer = PIT/APIC

Bus = connects everything together

That‚Äôs enough to make a bootable game OS üéÆ.
